The grep command is a built-in Linux command that allows you to search for lines that match a given pattern. By default, it returns all lines in a file that contain a specified string. The grep command is case-sensitive, but you can use specific parameters to modify its behavior.

To search for files containing a specific text string, you can use the following command

grep -rni "text string" /path/to/directory

-r performs a recursive search within subdirectories.
-n displays the line number containing the pattern.
-i ignores the case of the text string.
The above command will display all lines in the files within the specified directory that contain the given text string, along with the corresponding line numbers.

To filter the results and display only the filenames without duplication, you can use the following command:

grep -rli "text string" /path/to/directory

-l prints only the names of the files containing the pattern.
This command will provide a list of filenames that contain the specified text string, eliminating any duplicates.
